# Root Finding Methods using Julia
Numerical Methods Project. This notebook is written using Julia and contains different methods of finding the roots of a function.

ENGG 27.01: Numerical Methods Project using Julia. A good introductory article to Julia can be found here: https://medium.com/swlh/introduction-to-julia-946c242ddac1

Julia can be downloaded here: https://julialang.org/downloads/ and its documentation can be found at this link: https://docs.julialang.org/

Connecting Julia to Jupyter Notebook is as:

Install and run Julia.
Use the command using Pkg
Use Pkg.add("IJulia") after
Download Anaconda and run Jupyter Notebook and the Julia environment should be seen when the New command is clicked.

The following are the root finding methods covered in the notebook:
1. Bisection Method
2. Secant Method
3. Newton-Raphson Method
4. Muller's Method
5. Fixed Point Iteration Method

All algorithms and sources have been discussed and referenced within the notebook itself. Enjoy!
